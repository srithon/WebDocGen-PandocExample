#+TITLE: WebDocGen Pandoc Example

*See the output [[https://srithon.github.io/WebDocGen-PandocExample][here]]*.

This repository is linked to [[https://github.com/srithon/WebDocGen][WebDocGen]], a tool that I wrote for generating web
documentation.  To keep the parent repository from getting crowded with
generated assets, I'm instead hosting it in a separate repo.  This repo contains
a script that compiles ~example_input.md~ from the parent repository, creating
HTML files that can be viewed through GitHub Pages. It also contains
submodules, with commits pointing to both the parent repository as well as the
~easy-pandoc-templates~ repository which contains the templates that I am using
here.
